# CIC-Test

I chose the Virtuel White Board and focused on the backend.

# Virtual White Board

## Intro 
As we talk about fast mockup i will go with python as backend and if I would do a frontend i would do a React based website in Javascript on the frontend connecting with the API on the backend.

## Backend architechture
### API 
The API needs to support both login and data extraction for contents on the WhiteBoard. The architecture will look something like this. Did not have time to expand too much on the white board data.

### Login
A database setup should be provided for login credentials. Requirements
 * Generic login without an email attached to it.
 * Ability to reset password. Hence, an email need to be attached to this login.
 * Personal logins with attached email.
